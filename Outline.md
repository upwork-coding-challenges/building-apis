# Outline - Build Modern APIs in NodeJS

Welcome to the course, in this course we are going to learn how to build modern APIs using NodeJS. Mainly we will focus on REST API as it will be found all over the world. But we will also try to understand other popular competitors of REST APIs like GraphQL, JSON API, gRPC like techniques. End of this course you will learn - 

-   What is API (Application Programming Interface)
-   What is REST API (Representation State Transfer)
-   Why do We Need API
-   Best Alternatives of REST API and Their Use Cases
-   How to Implement REST API using Node and Express
-   How to Implement GraphQL API using GraphQL Yoga or Express GraphQL
-   JWT Authentication, Authorization & API Security
-   Design Principles or Best Practices of API Development
-   API Version Control and Documentation



This course will be the foundation of your backend journey using **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** two hot most and demandable technologies. If you never build any server side application yet don't worry, you are going to love the backend development process. NodeJS makes things easy for us. After completing this course you will never rely on AWS Amplify, Firebase or Superbase. You can build your own backend for your future frontend, mobile application or Saas projects.
