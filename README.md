# How to Build Web APIs in NodeJS (REST API, GraphQL)

This is a course on how to build Web APIs in NodeJS. It will cast a wide net covering a handful of popular API designs including RESTful APIs and GraphQL. It may also cover technologies like Websockets, gRPC, or any other trending API technology that will attract more customers.

This course is intended for the beginner to intermediate NodeJS developer who understands the syntax / semantics of JavaScript but is relatively new to backend development.

The following is NOT in scope for this course:

1. How to write JavaScript / Node
2. Databases & ORMs
3. Front end development (e.g. React, Angular, etc)

## What will this course look like?

This will be a video-course on Udemy / Skillshare, complete with quizzes and assignment. Each lesson will be comprised of a video about 10 minutes in length (some will be longer, some will be much shorter).

Each lesson will comprise mostly of me walking through code, with a set of powerpoint slides to reinforce the core concepts. I have included a demo file in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ul1m2AhgZMfxl5tFokGVUf8WYHdPoSb5/view?usp=sharing of the test video I sent to Udemy as an example of what a typical lesson would look like (start with slides, but mostly walking through code. Obviously a real lesson would be longer and contain more detail).

I would also like the course to use practical examples where ever possible, to give our students the full confidence to build a real REST API by the end of the course.

## Week 1: Course Outline

This week we will focus on making a detailed course outline that gives a lesson-by-lesson description of what this course will look like. Here are a handful of topics I want to cover:

- What is a Web API / Why build an API
- Design principles of an API (what makes a "good" API from a "bad" API)
- Designing and Building a RESTful API in NodeJS
- Designing and Building an API in GraphQL
- Security, Authorization, and Authentication

Here are a few optional topics we can include depending on the scope of the project:

- Websockets
- gRPC
- Any other popular API technology for web developers
- Deploying your API to the web

Time permitting, we can also start working on the powerpoint templates used for the slides in the lessons.

**Please do al of this work in a separate branch and create a pull request, just like the interview.**
